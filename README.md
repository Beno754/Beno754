## Welcome 👋

Hi, I’m Ben Edwards, A Process Engineer looking to become a full time software developer.
I have a love for constantly learning and developing my skills.
My first entry into programming was in 2008 when I started learning game development as a hobby.
Pairing my love for programming with mechanical design, I have made various projects you can find in my Github.

## 👍 I have knowledge in:
C#, C++, Java, HTML, Javascript.
Using Controllers such as Arduino and PLC to interface software with physical components

### 🤔 My current fascination is Assembly Code and how it is stored in memory to use with a project which needs to read process memory.

## 🎮 Game design has taught me various concepts:
 - User Interaction
 - Peer to Peer, Peer to Server, Lobby network architecture
 - Databases and Security.
 - API calling
 - State machines and decision trees

## 👨‍🔧 Process Engineering has taught me:
 - Great problem solving
 - Failure mode analysis and prevention
 - Mechatronic design

### 🧠 Aside from learning, I love to share my knowledge and create entertaining videos via youtube:
